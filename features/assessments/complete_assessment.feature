Feature: Complete an assessment
  As a phone agent
  I want to be guided through the assessment completion process
  So that I create the correct needs, notes and status changes

  Background:

    * the mdt role exists
    * an assessment is assigned to me

  Scenario: Complete assessment when no check in exists
    Given I have assigned needs "Groceries and cooked meals" to "Unassigned" for the assessment
    And I am on the assessment completion page
    Then I should be informed there are no scheduled further check ins

  Scenario: Complete assessment when a future check in exists
    Given the contact for the assessment has a scheduled check in
    And I have assigned needs "Groceries and cooked meals" to "Unassigned" for the assessment
    And I am on the assessment completion page
    Then I should see the date of the next check in
